plotbridge: A template-based bridge between Python and your plot engine
=======================================================================

With a plotbridge **template**, you can use your **favorite plotting
program** for visualizing the results of your Python data analysis or
simulation code. The purpose is to keep the Python side free of most
formatting details, while allowing arbitrarily complex templates (and
optional preprocessing steps) that can produce publication quality
plots in an automated and repeatable way.

See the `documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ at RTD (or the
:file:`docs` subdirectory) for instructions on getting started.
